/*
Develop a union-find implementation that uses the same basic strategy as weighted quick-union 
but keeps track of tree height and always links the shorter tree to the taller one. 
Prove a lgN upper bound on the height of the trees for N sites with your algorithm.

//hint: replace the sz[] array with a ht[] array such that ht[i] stores the height of the subtree rooted at i
