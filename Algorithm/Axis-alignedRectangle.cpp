/*
Describe an algorithm that takes an unsorted array of axis‐aligned rectangles and
returns any pair of rectangles that overlaps, if there is such a pair. Axis‐aligned
means that all the rectangle sides are either parallel or perpendicular to the x‐ and
y‐axis. You can assume that each rectangle object has two variables in it: the x‐y
coordinates of the upper‐left corner and the bottom‐right corner.
